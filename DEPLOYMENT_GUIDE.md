# ðŸš€ FJ Website Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your FJ e-commerce website to Vercel, making it publicly accessible on the internet.

## Prerequisites
- [GitHub account](https://github.com)
- [Vercel account](https://vercel.com) (free tier available)
- [Supabase project](https://supabase.com) (already set up)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Code for Production

### 1.1 Create a `.env.local` file (if you don't have one)
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional: Add any other environment variables you need
```

### 1.2 Test your build locally
Before deploying, make sure your app builds successfully:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pnpm install

# Build the application
pnpm build

# Test the production build locally
pnpm start
```

If the build succeeds and the app runs locally, you're ready to deploy!

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

### 2.1 Initialize Git (if not already done)
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - ready for deployment"
```

### 2.2 Create a GitHub repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it something like `fj-ecommerce-website`
4. Make it public or private (your choice)
5. Don't initialize with README (since you already have code)

### 2.3 Push your code
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fj-ecommerce-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### 3.1 Connect to Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/Login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository

### 3.2 Configure the project
Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project. Configure these settings:

**Framework Preset:** Next.js (should be auto-detected)
**Root Directory:** `./` (leave as default)
**Build Command:** `pnpm build` (or leave as default)
**Output Directory:** `.next` (leave as default)
**Install Command:** `pnpm install` (or leave as default)

### 3.3 Add Environment Variables
In the Vercel project settings, add these environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**Important:** Replace `your_supabase_project_url` and `your_supabase_anon_key` with your actual Supabase credentials.

### 3.4 Deploy
Click "Deploy" and wait for the build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes).

## Step 4: Configure Your Domain (Optional)

### 4.1 Custom Domain
1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `fj.com` or `yourstore.com`)
3. Follow Vercel's instructions to configure DNS

### 4.2 Vercel Subdomain
Your site will be available at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## Step 5: Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Shop page displays products
- [ ] Product detail pages work
- [ ] Add to cart functionality works
- [ ] Checkout process works
- [ ] Admin panel is accessible
- [ ] Order management works

### 5.2 Security Considerations

- [ ] Payment processing is secure (when implemented)

### 5.3 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Images are optimized
- [ ] Loading times are acceptable

- Set up error tracking (optional)
- Monitor performance metrics

### 6.2 Regular updates
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Backup your database regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails:**
- Check that all environment variables are set in Vercel
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check for TypeScript errors locally first

**Environment Variables Not Working:**
- Make sure they're set in Vercel project settings
- Redeploy after adding new environment variables
- Check that variable names match exactly

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct
- Check Supabase project is active
- Ensure RLS policies allow your operations

**Performance Issues:**
- Enable Vercel's edge caching
- Optimize images and assets
- Consider using CDN for static assets

## Next Steps

### E-commerce Features to Add
1. **Payment Processing**: Integrate Payfast or Stripe
2. **Email Notifications**: Set up order confirmations
3. **Inventory Management**: Real-time stock updates
4. **Analytics**: Track sales and user behavior
5. **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags, sitemap, etc.

### Marketing Features
1. **Newsletter Integration**: Email marketing
2. **Social Media**: Share buttons and feeds
3. **Reviews System**: Customer reviews and ratings
4. **Loyalty Program**: Points and rewards

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel's deployment logs
2. Review browser console for errors
3. Test locally with `pnpm build && pnpm start`
4. Check Supabase dashboard for database issues

## Cost Considerations

**Vercel (Free Tier):**
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- 100GB storage
- Automatic deployments
- Custom domains

**Supabase (Free Tier):**
- 500MB database
- 1GB file storage
- 50,000 monthly active users
- 2GB bandwidth

For most small to medium e-commerce sites, the free tiers should be sufficient to start.
